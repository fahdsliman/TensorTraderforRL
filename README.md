TensorTrade Trading Environment

A beginner-friendly Python project that creates a simulated trading environment using the TensorTrade library. It allows an AI to practice trading a fictional stock ("TTRD") on a virtual exchange ("TTSE") using historical price data, with no real money involved.
Purpose
This project sets up a virtual trading "world" where:

You start with $1,000 in cash and 0 stocks.
Trade a fictional stock ("TTRD") on a simulated exchange ("TTSE") with a 0.35% commission.
The AI uses historical stock data (prices and volume) to learn trading strategies.
Ideal for learning algorithmic trading and reinforcement learning in a safe, simulated environment.

Prerequisites

Python: Version 3.9 or higher.
GitHub: Account to fork or contribute (optional).
Data: A CSV file with historical stock data (see Data Format).

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/TensorTrade-Trading-Environment.git
cd TensorTrade-Trading-Environment


Set Up a Virtual Environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt



Data Format
The code expects a CSV file (e.g., data/data.csv) with the following columns:

Datetime: Date and time (e.g., "2023-01-01 09:30:00").
Open: Opening price.
High: Highest price.
Low: Lowest price.
Close: Closing price.
Volume: Trading volume.

Example (data.csv):
Datetime,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume
2023-01-01 09:30:00,100.5,101.2,100.1,100.8,1000
2023-01-01 09:31:00,100.8,101.5,100.6,101.2,1200

You can use real stock data (e.g., from Yahoo Finance) or create synthetic data.
Usage

Prepare Configuration:Create a Python dictionary in your script with these settings:
config = {
    "csv_filename": "data/data.csv",
    "reward_window_size": 10,  # Steps to measure profit
    "window_size": 20,         # Past data for AI
    "max_allowed_loss": 0.2    # Stop if 20% of cash is lost
}


Run the Environment:Save the configuration and run the main script:
from src.trading_env import create_env
env = create_env(config)
print("Trading environment created!")

This sets up the trading environment. You can extend it by adding an AI model (e.g., reinforcement learning) to train within this environment.


Project Structure

src/trading_env.py: Main script to create the trading environment.
data/data.csv: Sample historical stock data.
requirements.txt: Lists Python dependencies.
.gitignore: Excludes unnecessary files (e.g., virtual env, cache).
README.md: Project documentation.

How It Works
The code:

Loads Data: Reads stock prices from a CSV file.
Creates Exchange: Simulates a market ("TTSE") with a 0.35% commission.
Sets Up Portfolio: Starts with $1,000 and 0 stocks.
Streams Data: Provides price data for AI and visualization.
Defines Rules: Allows Buy, Sell, or Hold actions with profit-based rewards.
Builds Environment: Combines components into a trading simulator.

Next Steps

Train an AI model (e.g., using reinforcement learning) in this environment.
Add visualizations for trades (e.g., using Matplotlib).
Test with real-world stock data.
Enhance with features like transaction costs or risk management.
